* Better UI (progress bar rather than timer for countdown).
* GameLoop
* Better ball physics (Box2D)
* Leaderboards
* More ball types (e.g., multiball, sticky ball [where you shoot the ball from the paddle every time], tiny ball, big ball, brick-tracking ball)
* Sounds with increasing tone between bounces.
* Implement commentary with calls to an LLM such as LLama

# Time Details and Changelist
<Add information to this section about the time you've taken for this task along with a professional changelist.>

5 mins - Circlur include issue

1hr 10ins - Screen Shake
2hr - New powerup, implemented it one way then realised i could do it in a both better and cleaner way. The powerup is a "Split" powerup where when grabbed another ball will spawn and act like the first one, when this split ball passes the paddle, it deletes itself rather than health. These split balls can split themselves.
